# Charalt

A small application/project (first application I made btw) I made just to practice some python after learning it for about 2 weeks moving from JS. You can use it alter your text by making it all caps, lowercase, replacing/ removing certain characters from a sentence, paragraph, essay etc. It's kinda dumb I know, but it was just for practice. I called it Charalt becuase it involves character alteration (Char for character and the alt for alteration). You will first be introduced with the input text field that you can use to enter the text you want to alter. After submitting the text you want to alter, you will be taken to anotehr layout where you will choose how you want to alter the text. Use replacement for characters you choose from the text. You must also of course, choose the replacements for each character. NOTE that the length of both the chosen characters and replacemtns must of be the same. As for removing characters, you just choose the characters you want remove. The maximum amount of characters you can currently choose to replace or remove from your input is 14. You can also capitalize or lowercase your input or even output if there is output present. If there is no output, it just capitalized or lowercases the input and makes that the new output. The final function is reverting any output you may regret.

**libraries used:**
 
- kivy + kivymd (mostly kivymd)
- pyinstaller for converting the kivy application to an executable

This was a nice project and I enjoyed getting started with app developemnt. Well not exactly.. styling with kivy was a bit tough at first compared to css that I am used to. I look forward to making bigger applications in the future. Maybe with other libraries other than kivy as well I suppose.
