# Charalt
A small application I made just to practice some python after learning it for about 2 weeks moving from JS. You can use it alter your text by making it all caps, lowercase, replacing/ removing certain characters from a sentence, paragraph, essay etc. It's kinda dumb I know, but it was just for practice.
